# Accent_detection_NN


This repository contains a notebook and an associated streamlit app that is able to classify videos based on the english accent present in its audio. The notebook is used to develop the model using a convolutional neural network and then the model is saved. This model is then deployed on streamlit cloud which is used to classify videos wherein you are able to paste the url of the video. The app then classifies the english accent in the video based on the predefined classes.

For the purpose of this model, the classes are as follows.
1. English
2. Indian
3. East Asian
4. South East Asian
5. African
6. Middle Eastern, Central Asian or Southern Europe
7. Western European
8. Northern European
9. Eastern European
10. Oceanian or Other
